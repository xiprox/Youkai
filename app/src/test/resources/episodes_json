As Scar's group exits the mine, they find Al, who warns them about Central infiltrating Briggs, so Scar decides to take them towards an Ishbalan slum. Miles' group attempts to snipe Kimblee, but Kimblee has already figured out their intent and uses a cover of snow to enter the mines. Ed tries to follow, but is attacked by two more chimeras. Ed disables them by using the ammonia in dynamite to make a stink bomb to overwhelm their high sense of smell. Ed then knocks the Philosopher's Stone out of Kimblee's hand, but Kimblee uses another Stone hidden inside his mouth, sending Ed and the chimeras down a mine shaft and leaving Ed impaled by a steel bar. At the same time, Al starts to drift out of consciousness, saying his soul is being drawn back to his body. Determined not to die, Ed gets the chimeras to remove the bar while he sacrifices some of his life span to temporarily fix the wound and to stop the bleeding. The chimeras find the Philosopher's Stone that Kimblee dropped, and, thankful for their rescue, decide to take Ed to a doctor. ",

Meanwhile, 'Father' dreams of ancient Xerxes, where Hohenheim was raised as a nameless slave. There, Hohenheim met Homunculus, a being in a flask who was created from his blood, which gave Hohenheim his current name and taught him the basics of alchemy. One night, Homunculus was summoned by the King of Xerxes, who asked Homunculus to tell him the secret for immortality. Homunculus tricked the king into making a gigantic transmutation circle, using the whole country as a sacrifice, while it and Hohenheim stood at the center of the circle. When Hohenheim awoke, everyone else in Xerxes was dead, except for Homunculus. It created a body shaped like Hohenheim for itself, becoming 'Father.' Back in the present, after Hohenheim awakes from this shared dream, he runs into Izumi and Sig. When Hohenheim notices Izumi's sin, he rearranges her organs so that her blood can flow better. After this, Hohenheim tells Izumi and Sig that he is a Philosopher's Stone in human form. ",
