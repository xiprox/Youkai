      "synopsis": "In the year 2071, humanity has colonized several of the planets and moons of the solar system leaving the now uninhabitable surface of planet Earth behind. The Inter Solar System Police attempts to keep peace in the galaxy, aided in part by outlaw bounty hunters, referred to as \"Cowboys\". The ragtag team aboard the spaceship Bebop are two such individuals.\r\nMellow and carefree Spike Spiegel is balanced by his boisterous, pragmatic partner Jet Black as the pair makes a living chasing bounties and collecting rewards. Thrown off course by the addition of new members that they meet in their travels—Ein, a genetically engineered, highly intelligent Welsh Corgi; femme fatale Faye Valentine, an enigmatic trickster with memory loss; and the strange computer whiz kid Edward Wong—the crew embarks on thrilling adventures that unravel each member's dark and mysterious past little by little. \r\nWell-balanced with high density action and light-hearted comedy, Cowboy Bebop is a space Western classic and an homage to the smooth and improvised music it is named after.  \r\n[Written by MAL Rewrite]",

Most episodes are separate from each other, so you can watch the series in mostly any order. It makes it easy to jump right into an\nepisode without having to watch other ones. Each episode feels like it's a different genre from the last, with some being action packed, other being\nlighthearted and funny, while others a really serious. A lot of diversity here, which makes it an almost universal show. The central plot has to do\nmostly with Spike and his past, although the other characters get their time in the limelight too. My only complaint is how the cast even after\nsplitting up always seem to find each other in the end. They can travel the whole solar system, so it's a coincidence that happens a tad too often.\nLastly, this show has such an amazing ending that you can't help but love.Characters - 34/35 - One of the best cast of characters you could ask for.\nThey all just work so well together, and a very fun to watch. Spike in particular is very cool, and is probably the single coolest character in all of\nanime. The rest of the cast aren't slouches either, as they all have their good points. Even though we do learn a lot about their past and see them\nform a relationship with each other, I can't help but feel there is more to tell for each of them. The side characters are also very good, as is the\nmain villain. Sound - 15/15 - Arguably the best soundtrack in any show ever. I really love the score from this show, from its iconic opening, to all\nthe jazz spread through the show, to the ending. Each episode has a specific genre associated to it, and it's cool to see the music change along with\nthe episode. Also, it's probably the best example of English used properly in anime, and sounding VERY good and NOT like it's a separate language.\nAs you probably know, the dub for this show is phenomenal, and should be watched over the sub. Even if you are a sub purist, watch this show dubbed.\nAnimation - 13/15 - The best of the best for its time. Sadly, its time was 1999, which was a while ago. It still looks beautiful and has very fluid\nmovements, but it is still older. Overall - 93/100 - Damn this was a good show. Easily one of the best I have ever seen, and one everybody should see.\nDon't miss this show.\n\n",

        "content": "Cowboy Bebop is a really special anime. It is truly a great or not the greatest classic anime out there. Any anime fan should watch this because your\ncollection is without a doubt not complete without Cowboy Bebop.\n\n **Story** The story is probably the weakest category in Cowboy Bebop. Cowboy Bebop was set in the future where humanity has conquered most of the solar system.\nOur main character Spike Spiegel is a bounty hunter who earns money through collecting bounty. The story here is pretty much showing how Spike and his\ngang capture villains in an unpredictable and fashionable manner. Each episode has its own story to tell, either about the main characters or their\nnew target. There is a main and bigger storyline, although that is not what makes this show special.\n\n<strong> The positive:</strong>\n\n1\\. After episode 4, everything became amazing\n\n2\\. Each episodes are either fun, emotional or even creepy.\n\n3\\. Sometimes light hearted episodes are the best\n\n4\\. Creative and original storyline\n\n5\\. Background story for each characters are splendid\n\n6\\. Mature and realistic action by the characters\n\n<strong> The negative:</strong>\n\n1\\. Episode 1-4 are lacking, some people might even called it boring and I don't mind it\n\n2\\. The main storyline is unstable as they appear randomly\n\n3\\. The main storyline should be more focused and reveal more details\n\n **Animation** For a 1998 anime, the animation is really amazing. It is even better than some current anime. The animation was done by studio SUNRISE, the studio\nthat brought us many of the Gundam series, Code Geass and Tiger &amp; Bunny. The animation is smooth and fluid, especially the fighting scene. The\nbackground is very detailed; you can see the efforts that was put into making this anime alive.\n\n**The positive:**\n\n1\\. Detailed and beautiful background\n\n2\\. Smooth and fluid animation\n\n<strong> The negative:</strong>\n\n1\\. Animation can be more sharper\n\n2\\. Character facial expressions could be done better\n\n **Sound** You can also see the amount of efforts and ambitions SUNRISE has put into making the OST. There are various songs and soundtracks that are used only\nonce or twice for specific episodes. The purpose is to keep the viewers from getting bored listening to the same thing. The OP is also great and can\nbe consider a classic. It also matches the atmosphere of the show perfectly. The ED theme was lacking though, I find it uninteresting. The voice\nacting is truly amazing, both the sub and dub version. I am not a dub fan but I can say, Cowboy Bebop has one of the best dub in all of anime,\nespecially Faye. I personally find her English voice much more enjoyable than her original Japanese voice.\n\n<strong> The positive:</strong>\n\n1\\. Amazing Japanese and English dub\n\n2\\. A lot of efforts was put in to make the OST\n\n3\\. Classic and original OP theme\n\n<strong> The negative:</strong>\n\n1\\. Boring ED theme\n\nCowboy Bebop Opening \"Tank!\"\n\n **Character** Cowboy Bebop has a great cast of characters. The main characters are all bounty hunters who board the Bebop ship. Cowboy Bebop has a great cast of\ncharacters because it shows how mature and realistic their action is. Their interaction are all very enjoyable and a bliss to watch.\n\n<strong> The positive:</strong>\n\n1\\. Great cast of main characters\n\n2\\. Very original\n\n3\\. Interaction between characters are great\n\n4\\. Excellent character development\n\n5\\. Mature\n\n<strong> The negative</strong>\n\n1\\. Side characters and villain could be better\n\n2\\. Although the main characters are great, but they're not perfect\n\nCowboy Bebop's main characters\n\n **Enjoyment** This is a show mainly about making it's audience feel enjoyed rather than keeping them deep in though about the symbolism and deep meaning. I really\nenjoyed this show especially after episode 4. What I find lack enjoying is the main storyline as they are way too unfocused and uninteresting for me.\nI really enjoyed the fun lighthearted episodes more and all of the characters background.\n\n **Overall** This is a must watch show for all anime fans. This show really aims for mature audiences and despite its lighthearted and goofiness, there are some\ndeep meanings and symbolisms to be discovered. Cowboy Bebop stands out for being a really enjoyable show with great characters development despite\nlacking in the main storyline.\n\n Cowboy Bebop - 8.6 ***\"Bang..\"***\n\n\\- Spike Spiegel\n\n",

        "content": "<strong>Please Note: Funimation has licensed Cowboy Bebop. At the time I wrote this review, it was still available by Bandai Entertainment and then\nbecame out of print until Funimation rescued Cowboy Bebop from being out of print. </strong>\n\nCritic's Log: Earthdate - March 12, 2012. Review #1: Cowboy Bebop.\n\nIt is the year 2071 and Mars has become the central hub of human civilization ever since a hyperspace experiment on the moon failed and made Earth\nuninhabitable. The entire Solar System has been accessible thanks to reliable hyperspace gates and crime syndicates have exerted their power and\ninfluence over the government and the ISSP (Inter-Solar System-Police). As a result, The ISSP has put in a bounty system similar to The Old West has\nbeen included to deal with fugitives, terrorists and other criminals. The bounty hunters are usually called \"Cowboys\". Bounty hunters Spike Spiegel\nand Jet Black are flying around space and trying to catch their bounty.\n\nThat is the premise of Cowboy Bebop. This is where I start to get technical, Cowboy Bebop does not have much of a main storyline (except for episodes\nlike Ballad of Fallen Angels, the Two-part episode Jupiter Jazz and the two part finale The Real Folk Blues), and those 5 episodes are what you could\ncall \"plot\" episodes, while the remaining 21 are standalone episodes. With that said, those episodes are not even considered filler. Some of the\nideas in these standalone really stand out impressively. Here are some examples: Sympathy for the Devil, Waltz for Venus, Ganymede Elegy, etc., etc...\n\nIf there is a blinding aspect, it is the animation. For 1998, the animation was pretty good back then and still looks good today. Some episodes have\nsome cool animation effects as well. Sunrise is the animation studio behind Cowboy Bebop and that might not be saying much, however there is one\napparent note about this show, apparently Cowboy Bebop's success led to 3 staff members from Sunrise that co-founded the studio that we know today as\nStudio Bones. In other words, animes like RahXephon, Wolf's Rain, Eureka Seven, Darker than BLACK, Soul Eater, and both Fullmetal Alchemist animes\nwere apparently made possible due to Bebop's success. The action scenes are well animated, and the visuals are even breathtaking at times.\n\nIf there are any anime purists out there that have not seen Cowboy Bebop yet, consider this recommendation an exception, the English dub is very good\nand hardly flawed. Steven Jay Blum gives Spike a good badass tone to his character, Wendee Lee sounds both sexy and sensitive as Faye, Beau\nBillingslea has a cool father-like tone as Jet, and Melissa Fahn is charmingly silly as Edward. The dub can be considered better than the original\nJapanese version of the show, and I have known some purists that mention that Cowboy Bebop's dub was very good. I personally love the dub, it was\nspot-on and all the voices matched. So, what do I think of the subtitled version? Answer: I find it Underrated compared to the dub. The voice cast of\nthe subtitled version had some well-known voice actors such as Kouichi Yamadera, Megumi Hayashibara, Unsho Ishizuka, and even Norio Wakamoto is in the\nsubbed version. There is nothing wrong with the subtitled version; it may be a bit overshadowed by the dubbed Version\n\nIf there is an aspect that struck all the chords right is the soundtrack which is by Yoko Kanno. Some people consider Bebop's soundtrack to be her\nbest. There is one fact about the soundtrack is that Kanno-san formed a band known as The Seatbelts which includes over 70 musicians which resided in\nJapan, New York, and Paris. I consider it impressive. If you try listening to the soundtrack without the show, it may feel like you're listening to\nan album rather than a soundtrack. The soundtrack really made a permanent impression on me. My personal favorite moment that involved the soundtrack\nwas the two songs used in the cathedral scene, which were Rain and Green Bird. Hell, the opening theme kicks so much ass, and The Real Folk Blues is a\ngood closing theme. The soundtrack is... Groovy\n\nWhat really makes the show impressive is that some scenes have music playing and not have much dialogue in it. This is somewhat of a symbolic example\nthat silence can indeed be golden. This is Kanno-san’s most famous and critically acclaimed soundtrack. Otakus mostly rejoice when Kanno –san is\ninvolved in musical compositions ever since she finished her work on Cowboy Bebop. She is mostly a fan favorite in the anime fan base when it comes to\nthe music department and that should come as no surprise. She’s that popular and talented. I do appreciate the work she has done up to this very day.\n\nThe characters are also great. Spike is shown as a rogue badass with a past catching up to him. Jet appears to be a cool guy who happens to be the\nCaptain of the Bebop. Faye is a con-woman and an interesting character even though she is kind of rude. Ein is adorable, and Edward is a silly random\ncharacter that has a positive outlook in life. I think she was an awesome character for comic relief in the show. Some minor characters were also\ninteresting. There is a common theme that runs through all of the characters and that is the pasts of these characters. It's definitely an overused\ntrope but I think the past is something we all quite can't forget which doesn't make this trope clichéd, it's just a common one that is almost\nalways effective.\n\nCowboy Bebop claims to be a genre unto itself. I am not sure how to give a clear analogy on that, but it has interesting themes that are unique to the\nshow. There are some homages and send ups to famous movies in this show. This is a show that knew how to treat adults and people who like movies,\nmusic, Science Fiction, Western and so forth. Shinichiro Watanabe really nailed the direction of this anime because he always liked to mix up\ndifferent opposing styles to make something completely new and unordinary. Cowboy Bebop has elements of Western, Space Opera, Film Noir, Martial Arts,\nand Jazz music. All these elements blended extremely well and this was a very unique anime at the time and I can understand why this anime was so\nrevolutionary at the time. End Result: WINNING!\n\nSince the popularity of Cowboy Bebop soared past through the stars, is it even fair to say that this show is overrated? It is considered an\ninfluential anime and I see why, a lot of people have universally praised the hell out of this show. The stories, animation, characters, music, and\nstyle are blended in so well that it almost makes it hard to see animes of this caliber.\n\nIf there is a drawback, I could say that this show could have gone a bit longer, and on a personal note, Boogie Woogie Feng Shui was the only episode\nI did not like too much. If you like it, that's fine.\n\nIf you stick to the series long enough, I guarantee you'll like the ending. There are a lot of people that see the ending as one of the most fitting\nendings to an anime and it really ends with a bang. I'm dead serious, if you haven't seen this series then do yourself a favor and watch the damn\nshow, it will not disappoint you unless you are extremely picky.\n\nCowboy Bebop is available by Bandai Entertainment, and even though Bandai Entertainment no longer licenses anime, they mentioned that they will keep\ntheir current catalog, so apparently there's nothing to worry about this anime being out of print in the US (I hope). The manga adaptation Cowboy\nBebop: Shooting Star written by Hajime Yatate and illustrated by Cain Kuga and another manga adaptation of Cowboy Bebop also written by Hajime Yatate\nand illustrated by Yutaka Nanten were available by Tokyopop and It is possible that those two manga adaptations are out of print. Cowboy Bebop the\nMovie is available by Sony Pictures and I will review it next.\n\nWith that said, Cowboy Bebop is a smash hit jam-session that has become a genre unto itself; it has thrills, action, humor, and most of all fun. It is\na hard one not to like. However, Not only anime fans like this show, some people that don't watch anime much or even anime-haters admit this show is\nexceptional and they even liked the show. This show has an American influence and it appeals to viewers that like anime, sci-fi, action flicks, and\nwesterns. At the time I am posting this, this anime is still airing on Cartoon Network's Adult Swim block since 2001. The constant re-runs and the\nfan base have turned this anime to a cult classic (metaphorically speaking, it has a devoted fan base... nothing to do with religious cults or\nsomething like that; it's a play on words). It may not be everyone's cup of tea but it is definitely worth trying. It's an anime I sometimes quote\nas well as some others. Some will say that this is the greatest anime ever made, but that may be stretching it too much, but I will agree in calling\nit a revolutionary anime and a fun anime at that. it is truly a gem.\n\nI give Cowboy Bebop a 10 out of 10 (It is a MASTERPIECE!)\n\nFeel free to comment below and until then... Stay gold, Bang!\n\n",

        "content": "LOOK FOR\n\n* Dogfights (and spaceship battles)\n* Fistfights\n* Music (not part of the plot, but all kinds)\n* Down-to-earth Super Technology\n* Space Ships (big ones)\n* Chases and Races\n* Slapstick (a little)\n* Parody (also a little)\n\nCowboy Bebop is one of those series that takes a relatively tired concept and manages to breathe new life into it. In this case, the well-worn concept\nis a ragtag band of bounty hunters, tooling around in their quirky space ship, headed up by a slick gunslinger with a mysterious past. The refreshing\ntwist comes from a near-perfect combination of stylish directing, not-quite-formula characters, interesting setting, a mix of offbeat humor and drama,\nand a whole lot of very cool music. All of which makes Cowboy Bebop both a quality classic space adventure and entertainingly original.\n\nOne of the defining features of the series is its mix of moods; it's one of the few truly multi-genre series I can think of. Though there is a bit of\nongoing plot, most of the episodes are essentially self-contained stories tied together loosely by the motley crew of characters. About half of these\nare dark, serious episodes full of grim situations and stylish set-pieces. The other half are generally light (though never to the point of being\ntruly silly), with a relatively subtle, quirky sense of humor.\n\nThese two styles are almost never mixed within an episode, which works very well. The fun episodes are very much so, but never so silly that you\ncan't take the remainder of the stories seriously, while the serious half are executed well enough to easily stand with the best of that genre. And,\nby clearly segregating the two moods, the series avoided almost all of the emotional tug-of-war that you (or at least I) get with some series that try\nto be both funny and dramatic at the same time.\n\nThe range is even more impressive than just dark and light; although most of the humor is of the low-key, offhanded, quirky sort, there are a couple\nof parody-heavy, straight comedy episodes that are downright hilarious. These little gems even manage to feel at home in the series. One, Mushroom\nSamba, is a semi-parody of exactly the sort of too-cool hero the series is about (it even has several Shaft references), while the other, Toys in the\nAttic, is a direct parody of the original Alien movie. The latter starts out darned funny, but it builds to a 2001-inspired crescendo of music and\nvisuals that has to be one of the most oddly appealing pieces of filmmaking I can think of. I'll freely admit that I have a weird sense of humor, but\nI thought it was sheer brilliance.\n\nThat's the broad picture, but Cowboy Bebop has so many other things worth mentioning that it's hard to know where to start.\n\nI'll go with the one thing that the series is pretty much built on: *style*. Cowboy Bebop has style all over the place--from the visuals, to the\nmusic (I'll come back to that), to the settings, to the stories, this series is as slick as you could ask for in even the most serious of sci-fi. In\nfact, that's is the only significant problem I personally had with the series--there's slick style to spare, but substance was sacrificed to make\nroom for it--nearly every serious episode is entirely predictable. There are a few ongoing questions surrounding Spike's past, and about three minor\npoints at which you aren't quite sure how something will turn out, but for the most part the dramatic stories are about as formula and obvious as\nthey come.\n\nNow, don't get me wrong--I'm not saying the stories aren't good. Quite the contrary, they're usually quite interesting, exciting, and the classic\nplot-lines (particularly the dark, moody ones) are executed so well that they're a pleasure to watch, but don't come expecting anything\nunpredictable. If you just can't stand obvious plots or the occasional sacrifice of realism (or even making much sense) for the sake of style, you\nmight get annoyed once in a while, as I was. Those who prefer style over substance, on the other hand, should be drooling over what Cowboy Bebop has\nto offer.\n\nThat said, it easily makes up for the lack of story originality elsewhere. Take the world (or rather worlds--the characters are always hopping around\nthe solar system) it's set in. Each locale has a very distinct feel to it, none of which are generic sci-fi. There's an international feel to\neverything, with each location having the flavor of some particular period or nationality. Building on that is the fact that the locales aren't\none-shot deals--the characters return to familiar areas once in a while.\n\nAdding to the variety of the settings is the detail in them, not to mention almost everything else. I can't call it perfect, but the towns and cities\nof Cowboy Bebop have a level of crowded detail and a sense of being lived in (and of being functional enough *to* live in) that few sci-fi stories\nmanage. There's also a collection of little touches surrounding the main characters that add a sense of realism that could have easily been lacking.\nThey do stuff like cook food and eat, look up information on a variant of the Internet, and lay around on a beat-up couch... in their spaceship.\n\nThat sort of sci-fi that doesn't feel futuristic is the best part of the setting. There are spaceships and warp gates, sure, but that sort of thing\nisn't prevalent, and the rest of the technology has a down-to-earth, almost retro feel. The spaceships run out of gas, the computer links crash, the\nTV gets poor reception on backwater planets, and there is a grand total of one laser gun in the series--Spike's fighter has one that is used very\ninfrequently, and everything else just shoots regular bullets. (The concept of shell casings in space is very cool, in fact.) Heck, there are even\nspace truckers. In a few cases, it's so low-tech that the realism is perhaps questionable (they actually made an effort to patch a few tech holes in\nthe dubbed dialogue), but in all it gave me the feeling that these were normal people living in a slightly different place and time, and made it very\neasy to get a grasp on the setting. It also contributes a bit to the wild-west feel, though that theme is usually surprisingly subtle considering the\ntitle.\n\nMoving on, no discussion of a good anime series would be complete without bringing up the characters, and Cowboy Bebop had plenty of good ones. None\nare terribly original--we have the grumpy old bounty hunter with a mysterious past, the slick young bounty hunter with an even more mysterious past\nthat keeps coming back to haunt him, a self-serving gambler on the run with a mysterious past, and a slightly mentally unstable hacker punk (with--big\nsurprise--a mysterious past). Oh, and there's a genetically modified Welsh Corgi (with a mysterious past), which never does anything--it has\nunusually high intelligence, but only by dog standards.\n\nIndividually, the characters each have a good chunk of personality, and as a group they develop a semi-antagonistic dynamic that, by being neither too\nover-the-top nor too vicious, is fun and serves as the foundation for the whole series. There's also plenty of lively banter, which I enjoyed.\n\nThis dynamic is fueled by the acting, and this is one series where both languages are top-notch. The casting is dead-on and the match-up between the\noriginals and the dubbed versions is impressive. And, in both cases, all the characters have an effective emotional range all the way from silly to\nserious. Of particular note is the quality of the writing in the dub--almost shockingly good. The English dialogue is quite colorful--lots of accents,\nunusual voices, and odd expressions (particularly Jet's)--without seeming at all out of place. The Japanese has its own appeal and is equally well\ndone (though a bit less colorful) so it's just plain enjoyable to listen to in either language--take your pick. It's hard to choose any particular\nstandouts in a cast this good (even most of the minor characters are solid), but I'd single out Megumi Hayashibara's Fay in Japanese for her\nperpetually annoyed tone and Ed in the dub for some really bizarre (and very funny) speech patterns that fit the character to a T.\n\nThe expensive-looking visuals tie everything else together. All that style I talked about before is carried though in the art--dark, moody scenes and\nJohn Woo-esque action set pieces (there's a classic church shootout, for example) abound. The character designs are distinctive and varied, the\ncharacter art is very sharp, and the backgrounds are pretty, appropriately creative for a good sci-fi series, and usually quite detailed. The\nanimation is also of very high quality--from the character animation to the fast and slickly produced action sequences (they are rare, but there are\nsome great aerial dogfights), everything is well toward the top end of the OAV scale... and this is a TV series. Plus, there is lots of neat\nzero-gravity stuff (all executed marvelously, unless you get really picky).\n\nI haven't mentioned the music yet--the series is called Cowboy *Bebop*, after all--because I was saving the best for last. The score is downright\namazing, and I don't throw terms like that around lightly. The primary musical style is blues or jazz, but the range of musical genres represented is\na thing to behold--almost every episode has a different musical motif. From heavy metal (for the space trucker episode), to the perfect funky\naccompaniment to the '70s-style opening sequence, to \"The Real Folk Blues\" (the jazz end theme for most of the series), to the very cool worldbeat\nend theme used for \"Jupiter Jazz,\" it hits just about every musical genre you can think of at some point. And, even more surprisingly, they **all**\nwritten very well.\n\nAs if that weren't impressive enough, the bulk of the music was written by a single person, Yoko Kanno (of Macross Plus fame among other things).\nConsidering her previous work, it shouldn't be a surprise that she can cover such a wide range of styles, but all of it sounds so authentic, and so\ngood, that my hat goes off to her. I can't think of anywhere else you can find this sort of musical variety, but I can say that the music alone could\ncarry the series (not that it has to), and it gives Cowboy Bebop a flavor all its own.\n\nThat is pretty much everything I can think of to mention about Cowboy Bebop; in one episode it may be dark, stylized, and serious, and in another\nlight and filled with offbeat humor and antagonistic banter, but in every case it's done right. Back that up with a great cast and writing (in\nEnglish and Japanese, no less), fine visuals, cool retro-high-technology, and some of the most varied and well written music you're likely to hear\nanywhere, and you've got good anime. Cowboy Bebop isn't deep, but it has style and little bits of creativity everywhere to make up for what it lacks\nin substance, and from start to finish it's a marvelously well-built production. Worth at least a chance from almost any anime fan, and is almost\nguaranteed to be loved by fans of stylish action and sci-fi, as well those into both not-too-serious space adventure and way-too-serious space\nadventure.\n\n Related Recommendations The closest series in style and mood is almost certainly the live-action Firefly. Anime-wise, it stands pretty much on its own, but you might have a\nlook at Outlaw Star for a relatively similar (though less serious and less creative) spacefaring series. The heir apparent to the multi-genre twist on\nan old premise is the similarly named Samurai Champloo, but though it shares a lot with Cowboy Bebop, it's not quite as much of a consistent\nspectacle. There is, of course, a movie (\"Knockin' on Heaven's Door\") that is less a sequel than a side story.\n\n NOTES AND TRIVIA For those wondering, this series is not based on manga, although there are a few spin-off comics, available translated into English from Tokyopop.\n\nThis is a relatively random observation, but the money situation in the world of Cowboy Bebop seems a bit odd; if you assume a Woolong is worth in the\nrange of a US Dollar or Euro, then the bounties seem extravagant and the dire financial straits of the characters doesn't make sense. Yen, on the\nother hand, are only worth in the general range of 100 to the US Dollar or Euro right now, so numbers look big--something that would cost $250 in\nAmerica would be priced at about 25,000 yen in Japan. It would make sense for a Japanese series to use a denomination of money that's familiar to\ntheir intended viewers, in which case the bounties in the series are much more reasonable--a bounty of 1,000,000 would only end up being worth about\nUS$10,000, not in the same league at all. However, some of the numbers thrown around--the numbers on gambling chips and a fellow arguing over 100\nWoolongs in the value of a Welsh Corgi--make the issue a little fuzzier.\n\nAlso, if you noticed my comment about nit picking the zero-g scenes above, you might have been wondering what I meant. The thing is, in zero gravity,\nthere is no \"up.\" Hot air (or hot cigarette smoke, in this case) usually rises, as it did in this series when the characters were smoking without\nthe benefit of gravity. But, realistically, a burning cigarette's smoke would just sort of drift out in a small, even cloud from the tip of the\ncigarette. And actually, due to the lack of any convection currents, the tobacco-stick wouldn't even burn very well when you weren't sucking on the\nother end.\n\n",

In this case, the well-worn concept is a ragtag band of bounty hunters, tooling around in their quirky space ship, headed up by a slick gunslinger with a mysterious past. The refreshing twist comes from a near-perfect combination of stylish directing, not-quite-formula characters, interesting setting, a mix of offbeat humor and drama, and a whole lot of very cool music. All of which makes Cowboy Bebop both a quality classic space adventure and entertainingly original.</p><p>     One of the defining features of the series is its mix of moods; it's one of the few truly multi-genre series I can think of. Though there is a bit of ongoing plot, most of the episodes are essentially self-contained stories tied together loosely by the motley crew of characters. About half of these are dark, serious episodes full of grim situations and stylish set-pieces. The other half are generally light (though never to the point of being truly silly), with a relatively subtle, quirky sense of humor.</p><p>     These two styles are almost never mixed within an episode, which works very well. The fun episodes are very much so, but never so silly that you can't take the remainder of the stories seriously, while the serious half are executed well enough to easily stand with the best of that genre. And, by clearly segregating the two moods, the series avoided almost all of the emotional tug-of-war that you (or at least I) get with some series that try to be both funny and dramatic at the same time.</p><p>     The range is even more impressive than just dark and light; although most of the humor is of the low-key, offhanded, quirky sort, there are a couple of parody-heavy, straight comedy episodes that are downright hilarious. These little gems even manage to feel at home in the series. One, Mushroom Samba, is a semi-parody of exactly the sort of too-cool hero the series is about (it even has several Shaft references), while the other, Toys in the Attic, is a direct parody of the original Alien movie. The latter starts out darned funny, but it builds to a 2001-inspired crescendo of music and visuals that has to be one of the most oddly appealing pieces of filmmaking I can think of. I'll freely admit that I have a weird sense of humor, but I thought it was sheer brilliance.</p><p>     That's the broad picture, but Cowboy Bebop has so many other things worth mentioning that it's hard to know where to start.</p><p>     I'll go with the one thing that the series is pretty much built on: <em>style</em>. Cowboy Bebop has style all over the place--from the visuals, to the music (I'll come back to that), to the settings, to the stories, this series is as slick as you could ask for in even the most serious of sci-fi. In fact, that's is the only significant problem I personally had with the series--there's slick style to spare, but substance was sacrificed to make room for it--nearly every serious episode is entirely predictable. There are a few ongoing questions surrounding Spike's past, and about three minor points at which you aren't quite sure how something will turn out, but for the most part the dramatic stories are about as formula and obvious as they come.</p><p>     Now, don't get me wrong--I'm not saying the stories aren't good. Quite the contrary, they're usually quite interesting, exciting, and the classic plot-lines (particularly the dark, moody ones) are executed so well that they're a pleasure to watch, but don't come expecting anything unpredictable. If you just can't stand obvious plots or the occasional sacrifice of realism (or even making much sense) for the sake of style, you might get annoyed once in a while, as I was. Those who prefer style over substance, on the other hand, should be drooling over what Cowboy Bebop has to offer.</p><p>     That said, it easily makes up for the lack of story originality elsewhere. Take the world (or rather worlds--the characters are always hopping around the solar system) it's set in. Each locale has a very distinct feel to it, none of which are generic sci-fi. There's an international feel to everything, with each location having the flavor of some particular period or nationality. Building on that is the fact that the locales aren't one-shot deals--the characters return to familiar areas once in a while.</p><p>     Adding to the variety of the settings is the detail in them, not to mention almost everything else. I can't call it perfect, but the towns and cities of Cowboy Bebop have a level of crowded detail and a sense of being lived in (and of being functional enough <em>to</em> live in) that few sci-fi stories manage. There's also a collection of little touches surrounding the main characters that add a sense of realism that could have easily been lacking. They do stuff like cook food and eat, look up information on a variant of the Internet, and lay around on a beat-up couch... in their spaceship.</p><p>     That sort of sci-fi that doesn't feel futuristic is the best part of the setting. There are spaceships and warp gates, sure, but that sort of thing isn't prevalent, and the rest of the technology has a down-to-earth, almost retro feel. The spaceships run out of gas, the computer links crash, the TV gets poor reception on backwater planets, and there is a grand total of one laser gun in the series--Spike's fighter has one that is used very infrequently, and everything else just shoots regular bullets. (The concept of shell casings in space is very cool, in fact.) Heck, there are even space truckers. In a few cases, it's so low-tech that the realism is perhaps questionable (they actually made an effort to patch a few tech holes in the dubbed dialogue), but in all it gave me the feeling that these were normal people living in a slightly different place and time, and made it very easy to get a grasp on the setting. It also contributes a bit to the wild-west feel, though that theme is usually surprisingly subtle considering the title.</p><p>     Moving on, no discussion of a good anime series would be complete without bringing up the characters, and Cowboy Bebop had plenty of good ones. None are terribly original--we have the grumpy old bounty hunter with a mysterious past, the slick young bounty hunter with an even more mysterious past that keeps coming back to haunt him, a self-serving gambler on the run with a mysterious past, and a slightly mentally unstable hacker punk (with--big surprise--a mysterious past). Oh, and there's a genetically modified Welsh Corgi (with a mysterious past), which never does anything--it has unusually high intelligence, but only by dog standards.</p><p>     Individually, the characters each have a good chunk of personality, and as a group they develop a semi-antagonistic dynamic that, by being neither too over-the-top nor too vicious, is fun and serves as the foundation for the whole series. There's also plenty of lively banter, which I enjoyed.</p><p>     This dynamic is fueled by the acting, and this is one series where both languages are top-notch. The casting is dead-on and the match-up between the originals and the dubbed versions is impressive. And, in both cases, all the characters have an effective emotional range all the way from silly to serious. Of particular note is the quality of the writing in the dub--almost shockingly good.

        "content": "ANIME NOSTALGIA, PART 45Preceded by: Princess Mononoke (1997)Followed by: Serial Experiments Lain (1998)COWBOY BEBOP (1998)This is a hard to judge\nanime as it has many elements that make it good next to other elements that you need to tolerate if you need to consider them great. Although it is\nstill considered top 10 of all times for many after all these years, there are many more (me included) that had a very hard time accepting all that as\ntop material.I will start with an easy part to judge; its animation and artwork. I have absolutely nothing against them and I accept them as they are.\nThe setting is as they designated a space western; meaning a blend of the Wild West with some futuristic elements. And true, you get a highly\ntechnological advanced world full of spaceships and computers, next to sceneries full of societies that still seem to dwell in the 19th century.\nBesides being a gimmick to attract attention it is also part of the themes of the story as it used as such to create an antithesis of values. In many\nparts of the series, moral values are trampled over consumerism and exploitation and the visuals work as means to make that al cleared. Here you have\nthe romantic image of a lone cowboy living in the wilderness, looking forward to adventure, finding gold, having brawls in taverns and singing songs\naround a campfire with a banzo, with his only company being the howling wolves at the full moon, his trusty horse and a copper plate of cold beans.\nIsn’t that nostalgic or what?Well, the show is actually trying to inflict you indirectly with such notions, as each villain is pretty much someone who\ntakes advantage of ideals and naivety as means to get rich or powerful. You constantly see advertisements of products promising happiness, people\nclaiming money can buy happiness and leaders convincing followers to do bad things for the greater good. All that as intertwined with the feeling of\nthe visuals and thus create a very interesting atmosphere. Although there are other space western-style anime like Outlaw Star or Trigun, none had\nused the setting as means to tell a message. It was just for show and that is why Cowboy Bebop is by far the best in this sub-genre.There are other\nthings besides the artwork that works in the show, and that is the generally high production values. The characters and the backgrounds are very\ndetailed and lively for the time the anime was made, with very good body language, facial grimaces and usually small albeit good action scenes. All\nthat together leads me into giving artwork and animation the full score. It deserves it.I will now move to the characters, another part that is easy\nto excuse. Although the main characters begin as somewhat stereotypes, along the way they are fleshed out a lot and by the end of the show they become\nlovable and memorable. The tricky thing is that you need to find all the fleshing out by paying attention to THEM and not the OBJECTIVES of the story.\nFor you see, the characters don’t have clear motives from the start and each episode does not consciously bring them closer to their ulterior motives.\nEach mission provides small bits of information around each one of them and as long as you pay attention to those then you really get to see how they\nbecome more colorful and likable with each passing episode. As someone else told me, it is highly ironic how a mostly episodic series like Cowboy\nBebop develops its characters a lot more than most shows with an on-going story. Because most such shows would have a lot of dead time where nothing\nnew or of importance is revealed about the characters or the setting. Cowboy Bebop is constantly offering insight to its setting and cast and that is\nwhat makes it so great.As far as personalities go, pretty much everybody in this show is nihilistic and selfish, aiming for money and not some ideal\nlike world peace. The heroes are just mercenaries, their employers are usually greedy capitalists, the people on television just want to brainwash you\nwith hollow consumerism, and generally everybody is out for personal gain. This sort of treatment was back then rather unorthodox, as the heroes would\nusually be idealistic fools and such traits would only be found in a few selective villains, while all the rest of humanity would just be apathetic\nand passive to all that. This anime offers a somewhat similar mentality to everybody and the only thing to set them apart ends up being different\nmoral values or different short-sighted goals. Instead of going for an objective that may take decades, we mostly get to see ephemeral goals, which\nallow you to focus more on how they think and not how they progress towards that goal. One can even say that this way they constantly need to adapt to\neach given goal and thus are far more intellectual than most teen shows where heroes and villains have a one-dimensional line of thought and stick to\nthat for the entire show no matter what happens.So if I am to judge the characters, I say they are interesting, have quirks to become easily\nmemorable, get colorized, get indirectly developed, and even receive somewhat of a catharsis in the end. All of which happen in a mostly episodic show\nwhich makes the whole deal even more amazing. Thus I again give the characters the full score.And now for the story, which is the first hard to\nexplain thing. I have already described how it has a great setting and gradually developed characters but it is otherwise episodic. It is a bit hard\nto get attached to any individual situation if everything is resolved in one or two episodes. The core themes are always present and remain constant\nthroughout the various stand-alone missions and that may keep you permanently attached to the mood of the show. That still does not feel too good to\nanyone (like me) who prefers and on-going plot that an episodic one. And yes, you gradually see more to the characters which may be perceived as\non-going but that has to do with the cast and not the story. One could of course label this anime as 100% character-driven and thus share the same\nscore with the characters. I also prefer it when the story moves forward by personal choice and not pulled by the nose because the scriptwriter said\nso and was unable to show it otherwise. On the other hand, you still see many characters for just one episode doing stuff that do not matter\nthereafter, which still makes you feel like they are wasting potential here. Wouldn’t be amazing if a few secondary elements were affecting later\nmissions? Or if they were at least mentioned in passing? In all honesty, there actually is a story in the finale, which somewhat brings closure to the\nentire show (it is deliberately open to interpretation) and thus it does at least feel like it didn’t end as aimless as it began.The story is a very\ninteresting take on episodic-formats but it is still not perfect for me as I always prefer an on-going plot to this. I would normally give it the\nbase, but seeing how it smartly threw in character development here and there, I will raise it a lot more.The sound department is another hard thing\nto explain. It is a blend of various types of music, mostly Jazz, Blues and Country. I was never a fan of such music; I’m more of a metal and hard\nrock dude. Listening to these songs was very hard to get into the mood of the show, especially when one is accustomed to the usual jpop or retro\nballads. And yeah-yeah, I know how Jazz is the ultimate genre when it comes to passionate music and all others took pointers from it and are\nconsidered by the hardcores as watered down variations. I have heard that debate a billion times already. That still doesn’t mean I get to like\nhearing to those trumpets and basses for more than a few minutes. I otherwise clearly comprehend how the soundtrack of this anime is simply amazing in\nits execution. It doesn’t take a genius to realize it was done with passion and love for what it is all about. Personal tastes aside, I gladly admit\nit has the most awesome Jazz music ever heard in anime and the OST is easily ranked in quality in the anime top 10 of all times. There, see, I admit\nit.I have no problem with the voice acting or the sound effects. None felt amateurish or lazy at any given point and they fit their roles perfectly.\nSo in overall, despite not being a fan of such music (even hating it subconsciously) I objectively give the sound department the full score.There is\nno need of analysis on the value of this anime. Gets the full score from the get-go for being one of the most memorable, different, quality material\nshows of the late 20th century. People still praise it and it’s not for its naked chicks or gay protagonists \\*coughcodegeass\\*.Enjoyment… A\ncompletely personal section. It was episodic and had music I didn’t like. I dropped it 3 times before finally completing it and forgetting most of\neverything besides the main key events on each person’s backdrop stories. And that is pretty much all I can say to excuse my tastes. In fact, I got to\nenjoy more Watanabe’s later Samurai Champloo series, because Hip-hop and Kapoera samurais felt more captivating than Jazz cowboys in space. Yeah-yeah,\nI know Hip-hop is Jazz with stupid beats and lame lyrics, blah-blah. I’m not saying it is a boring show but not a show non-Jazz/episodic fans will\nenjoy to its fullest. That is all.\n\n",

Although there are other space western-style anime like Outlaw Star or Trigun, none had used the setting as means to tell a message. It was just for show and that is why Cowboy Bebop is by far the best in this sub-genre.There are other things besides the artwork that works in the show, and that is the generally high production values. The characters and the backgrounds are very detailed and lively for the time the anime was made, with very good body language, facial grimaces and usually small albeit good action scenes. All that together leads me into giving artwork and animation the full score. It deserves it.I will now move to the characters, another part that is easy to excuse. Although the main characters begin as somewhat stereotypes, along the way they are fleshed out a lot and by the end of the show they become lovable and memorable. The tricky thing is that you need to find all the fleshing out by paying attention to THEM and not the OBJECTIVES of the story. For you see, the characters don’t have clear motives from the start and each episode does not consciously bring them closer to their ulterior motives. Each mission provides small bits of information around each one of them and as long as you pay attention to those then you really get to see how they become more colorful and likable with each passing episode. As someone else told me, it is highly ironic how a mostly episodic series like Cowboy Bebop develops its characters a lot more than most shows with an on-going story. Because most such shows would have a lot of dead time where nothing new or of importance is revealed about the characters or the setting. Cowboy Bebop is constantly offering insight to its setting and cast and that is what makes it so great.As far as personalities go, pretty much everybody in this show is nihilistic and selfish, aiming for money and not some ideal like world peace. The heroes are just mercenaries, their employers are usually greedy capitalists, the people on television just want to brainwash you with hollow consumerism, and generally everybody is out for personal gain. This sort of treatment was back then rather unorthodox, as the heroes would usually be idealistic fools and such traits would only be found in a few selective villains, while all the rest of humanity would just be apathetic and passive to all that. This anime offers a somewhat similar mentality to everybody and the only thing to set them apart ends up being different moral values or different short-sighted goals. Instead of going for an objective that may take decades, we mostly get to see ephemeral goals, which allow you to focus more on how they think and not how they progress towards that goal. One can even say that this way they constantly need to adapt to each given goal and thus are far more intellectual than most teen shows where heroes and villains have a one-dimensional line of thought and stick to that for the entire show no matter what happens.So if I am to judge the characters, I say they are interesting, have quirks to become easily memorable, get colorized, get indirectly developed, and even receive somewhat of a catharsis in the end. All of which happen in a mostly episodic show which makes the whole deal even more amazing. Thus I again give the characters the full score.And now for the story, which is the first hard to explain thing. I have already described how it has a great setting and gradually developed characters but it is otherwise episodic. It is a bit hard to get attached to any individual situation if everything is resolved in one or two episodes. The core themes are always present and remain constant throughout the various stand-alone missions and that may keep you permanently attached to the mood of the show. That still does not feel too good to anyone (like me) who prefers and on-going plot that an episodic one. And yes, you gradually see more to the characters which may be perceived as on-going but that has to do with the cast and not the story. One could of course label this anime as 100% character-driven and thus share the same score with the characters. I also prefer it when the story moves forward by personal choice and not pulled by the nose because the scriptwriter said so and was unable to show it otherwise. On the other hand, you still see many characters for just one episode doing stuff that do not matter thereafter, which still makes you feel like they are wasting potential here. Wouldn’t be amazing if a few secondary elements were affecting later missions? Or if they were at least mentioned in passing? In all honesty, there actually is a story in the finale, which somewhat brings closure to the entire show (it is deliberately open to interpretation) and thus it does at least feel like it didn’t end as aimless as it began.The story is a very interesting take on episodic-formats but it is still not perfect for me as I always prefer an on-going plot to this. I would normally give it the base, but seeing how it smartly threw in character development here and there, I will raise it a lot more.The sound department is another hard thing to explain. It is a blend of various types of music, mostly Jazz, Blues and Country. I was never a fan of such music; I’m more of a metal and hard rock dude. Listening to these songs was very hard to get into the mood of the show, especially when one is accustomed to the usual jpop or retro ballads. And yeah-yeah, I know how Jazz is the ultimate genre when it comes to passionate music and all others took pointers from it and are considered by the hardcores as watered down variations. I have heard that debate a billion times already. That still doesn’t mean I get to like hearing to those trumpets and basses for more than a few minutes. I otherwise clearly comprehend how the soundtrack of this anime is simply amazing in its execution. It doesn’t take a genius to realize it was done with passion and love for what it is all about. Personal tastes aside, I gladly admit it has the most awesome Jazz music ever heard in anime and the OST is easily ranked in quality in the anime top 10 of all times. There, see, I admit it.I have no problem with the voice acting or the sound effects. None felt amateurish or lazy at any given point and they fit their roles perfectly. So in overall, despite not being a fan of such music (even hating it subconsciously) I objectively give the sound department the full score.There is no need of analysis on the value of this anime. Gets the full score from the get-go for being one of the most memorable, different, quality material shows of the late 20th century. People still praise it and it’s not for its naked chicks or gay protagonists *coughcodegeass*.Enjoyment… A completely personal section. It was episodic and had music I didn’t like. I dropped it 3 times before finally completing it and forgetting most of everything besides the main key events on each person’s backdrop stories. And that is pretty much all I can say to excuse my tastes. In fact, I got to enjoy more Watanabe’s later Samurai Champloo series, because Hip-hop and Kapoera samurais felt more captivating than Jazz cowboys in space. Yeah-yeah, I know Hip-hop is Jazz with stupid beats and lame lyrics, blah-blah. I’m not saying it is a boring show but not a show non-Jazz/episodic fans will enjoy to its fullest. That is all.  </p>",

However, I'll have to admit that when I was younger I\ndidn't really like Bebop but  after I sort of became older, somewhere  in college, I began to see what was so great and what were people talking\nabout all the time. So... Bebop was pretty influential and all, you hear sometimes how it's supposed to be one of the things that Tarantino was\nwatching when shooting Kill Bill and how Whedon got all of his Firefly thingy out of Bebop while Bebop itself got stuff from Outlaw star.*\n\n<u>What we talk about when we talk about Cowboy Bebop?</u>\n\nThe show itself shows many references to pop culture, or well...  the ideas of it, mostly western culture and the values that are connected with us\nand probably not as much with Japan even though I'm not quite sure what I'm even talking about. What I mean by that is that the show itself feels\nright. It feels like a love letter to hard boiled detective stories. But that's not the first case.  The things with east-west and taking stuff from\neach other isn't anything new.  Take for instance Star Wars. A fantasy space opera that great inspiration and sort of adapted a Japanese story, the\nfilm *The Hidden Fortress(1958)* by Akira Kurosawa. *Blade Runner* or any other cyberpunk work could also fit the bill since Japan and their culture\nis also for the setting important. So in these stories, these which I really like everything blends in and gets a different perspective. For instance,\nI really love the books of Haruki Murakami but his books even though they are set in Japan aren't \"Japanese\" at all, he rejects this Mishima style\nof writing and based his books on psychodelic magical realism fueled by Raymond Carver and Dostoevsky.Btw, his books I think are good. So we take the\nbest of both worlds and get something amazing.

What also speaks for this postmodern feel to it is that it's something\nnew while blending into a sort of cliche of a story. It's filled with humor and inside jokes. The dialogue is snappy and characters interesting.\nOften times it's just fun them seeing how they don't do anything at all, it's not always about the action or a straight story. It's also about\ndrugs. Also like <i>Pulp Fiction  </i>there isn't really a fixed message. I don't think it's good that I write so much bs about the show anyway but\nit's much better to fuck the shut up xD and just watch it. Not think much about it and let it remind you of whatever you want. If it got you\nintrigued it did it's job, if not f\\*\\*\\* it and move on. What else do I think about? Well... it's as I said somehow postmodern but even though I'm\ncompletely sure how it works for movies. Sure I've seen my share of French New Vawe stuff and Fellini and some Linklater,PTA stuff too. But I sort of\nsee that postmodern books work differently. Also, there's a lot of mysticism that adds Bebop things which make it a very unique show. There perhaps\nare many theories or stuff that Spike could be considered something like Jesus(even though I don't believe in this) and the religious immages...  So\ntradition and a drug fueled society crash together, all the bs that is happening makes the characters in Bebop somehow miserable which would explain\nwhy there's so much blues and jazz in it.

        "content": "**Introduction:**\n\nOn October 24th, 1998, Cowboy Bebop started its first full airing in Japan, it ended the next year on April 24th. It was later broadcasted in the\nUnited States as the first anime to ever appear on Adult Swim, and it still is broadcasted on a loop to this day. Now, as many of you probably know\nCowboy Bebop is definitely a very popular anime, and it's no wonder it's still broadcasting today, even after most anime have left Adult Swim. Why\nis so popular though? Well the answer is simple, Cowboy Bebop is a very finely crafted, almost perfect creation that deserves every bit of popularity\nit gets. With that said, let's get started with the review.\n\n**Actual Review:**\n\nLet's start with a plot summary, Cowboy Bebop, follows a group of bounty hunters in the distant future who have various missions and members focused\non each episode. There's Spike Spiegel, a cool and rowdy man who can fight very well, with a mysterious past to boot. Next, there's Jet, the founder\nof the Bebop crew and a former ISSP Officer, or a police officer if you prefer, with a missing arm and is the intelligence of the group. Then we have\nthe lovely lady, Fei Valentine, a gambling, trouble making woman who has a mysterious problem. Lastly there's Edward, she's the crazy hacker from\nEarth who is the comic relief for a lot of the show, we will get to how that's a problem later.\n\nNow that's pretty much it for the plot, that may not seem like much, but it is a lot bigger in execution. Like in my previous review Samurai\nChamploo, the plot doesn't really have much of an overarching story, it's mostly vignettes and character pieces that delve deeper into the cast or\nare just fun adventures to watch. Unlike Samurai Champloo however, these vignettes do actually develop the characters and have some interesting themes\nor surprises in them. Some make you think, others make you laugh, Cowboy Bebop really just has a very large range of tone. This is probably one of the\nshow's greatest strengths, it really knows how to use its characters and setting, it also takes them seriously allowing for a greater sense of\nimmersion.\n\nThis is of course all thanks to the direction and writing. This was Shinichiro Watanabe's first full director job and what a great job he did. Not to\nmention the gorgeous cinematography and use of lighting in the whole thing. There is rarely a sour beat in the whole show with only a few episodes\nbeing mediocre. Of course this is also because of the shows head writer Keiko Nobumoto, who has written other amazing anime such as Wolf's Rain and\nMacross Plus. With shows like that under his belt it's no wonder the show turned out to have some very witty and engaging dialogue, filled with great\ncharacter interactions and being able to create any emotion it desires.\n\nThere's also the gorgeous music, which was done by the stellar composer and goddess of all amazing anime music, Yoko Kanno. The soundtrack can range\nfrom passionate jazz to quiet ambience of instruments. There's also the scene near the end of Episode 5, Ballad of Fallen Angels, where they combine\namazing visuals and great music to make you go into an orgasmic bliss. Really it's some stellar work by an already amazing artist.\n\nSpeaking of which both the openings and endings of the shows are also great. Tank!, which was also done by Kanno, is the opening for every single\nepisode and get's me pumped to watch the show every time I see it. Not to mention it's hard not to tap your foot along to, it's probably one of the\nbest openings ever conceived. The ending however, is a very passionate and beautiful ballad called, the Real Folk Blues. This ending while not my\nfavorite is very good with a great vocals and visuals of Spike's past giving you a small glimpse of his character.\n\nWith that said and done, the animation is also gorgeous. This show was produced by Sunrise and if you don't know much about their studio, they have\nproduced shows such as Gundam and Escaflowne, which also looked great. Cowboy Bebop also was one of the last shows to be hand drawn, instead of being\nanimated digital technology used today. However, it's just as fluid if not better than a lot of shows that come out today. Also fun fact: while this\nshow was technically made by Sunrise, most of the staff who worked on it later moved on to make Studio Bones who's first project was the Cowboy Bebop\nmovie. So make take that as you may.\n\nThen there's the world famous dub, which is even makes dub haters say, \"If I watch a dub, it's Cowboy Bebop.\" Every character has the right voice\nand it, unlike many anime at the time, takes itself seriously enough to make it seem realistic. Steven Blum is amazing a Spike, Beau Billingslea gives\nJet the right amount of grumpiness and reason, Wendee Lee gives an amazing performance as the arrogant Fei, and Melissa Fahn gives the right amount on\ninsanity and smartness to the character of Edward. Not to mention all the side characters have great casting to, which I don't think even happened\nwith the best dubs back then. There are very few, if any, stumbles in this dub and it has become an example of what all dubs should strive for.\n\nSo with all of these good things said about the show, does it have any problems? Well there are a few, but they are very minor so get prepared for\nsome nitpicking. First off, Edward is kind of destroys the tone of some episodes. Now I'm ok with comic relief characters, really I am, but that's\nreally one of Ed's only purposes. She is probably the least developed of the cast and while she does get a backstory, overall, she just kind of ruins\nsome parts of the show. Not to say she like makes a whole episode of the show complete crap, that never happens, but she can seem just a little out of\nplace in some of the shows 26 episodes. Really though, that's the shows biggest problem, besides that the other problems are mostly just extremely\nminor and won't ruin your overall enjoyment.\n\n**Verdict:**\n\nReally, there isn't much to say about Cowboy Bebop because really it's almost completely without flaw. There's no need to explain what's good\nabout it because if there's something you don't like, there will probably be something you will like. There is nothing else I can say besides go see\nit, Bebop really deserves all the popularity and attention it gets. Before I go I'd also like to mention the Cowboy Bebop Movie, which is a basically\njust an episode of the show, but much longer and with equally great writing. Also this show was distributed by Bandai Entertainment, though there\napparently going out of business, so you should probably get a copy before the show becomes really expensive. Then again, I doubt this show will stay\nunlicensed for long after Bandai's demise... So in the end, go see Bebop, you have nothing to lose except free time.\n\n**Score: 9.7/10**\n\n",
        "contentFormatted": "<p><strong>Introduction:</strong></p><p>  On October 24th, 1998, Cowboy Bebop started its first full airing in Japan, it ended the next year on April 24th. It was later broadcasted in the United States as the first anime to ever appear on Adult Swim, and it still is broadcasted on a loop to this day. Now, as many of you probably know Cowboy Bebop is definitely a very popular anime, and it's no wonder it's still broadcasting today, even after most anime have left Adult Swim. Why is so popular though? Well the answer is simple, Cowboy Bebop is a very finely crafted, almost perfect creation that deserves every bit of popularity it gets. With that said, let's get started with the review.</p><p><strong>Actual Review:</strong></p><p>  Let's start with a plot summary, Cowboy Bebop, follows a group of bounty hunters in the distant future who have various missions and members focused on each episode. There's Spike Spiegel, a cool and rowdy man who can fight very well, with a mysterious past to boot. Next, there's Jet, the founder of the Bebop crew and a former ISSP Officer, or a police officer if you prefer, with a missing arm and is the intelligence of the group. Then we have the lovely lady, Fei Valentine, a gambling, trouble making woman who has a mysterious problem.

        "content": "Today, I bring you a review of an anime that some call the best anime ever. I am of course referring to the legendary Cowboy Bebop. A 1998 anime\nproduced by Sunrise, and directed by Shinichiro Watanabe. Also as a side note, the team from sunrise that created Bebop later left to form Studio\nBones.\n\n-**Plot**\n\nThe plot of Bebop is a simple one. The story follows a group of bounty hunters and their various exploits throughout the solar system. The show is\nvery episodic, so for the most part, every episode is a new story. This goes on up until the end, where they establish a long term narrative to finish\nout the show. The show has a great balance of comedy and seriousness, with most of the funny episodes being at the beginning of the show, and the more\nserious moments occur after the long term narrative has been implemented. The plot is very fun throughout, and\n\n-**Characters**\n\nOur main characters are:\n\n-Spike Spiegel: Arguably the *main* main character. A bounty hunter whose past is a mystery throughout most of the anime, and who is also a\nprofessional certified bad-ass.\n\n-Jet Black: Friend of Spike, and also an ex police officer. Like Spike, his past is mostly a mystery throughout the anime, revealing only fragments\nhere and there. Jet is also the owner of their space ship, the “Bebop”\n\n-Faye Valentine: Initially joins the Bebop to escape being killed by people whom she owes money to. She eventually becomes a permanent member of the\ncrew, however any money she gets her hands on, she immediately gambles away.\n\n-Radical Edward: A talented computer hacker. Unlike her name would suggest, she is a girl in the anime, in the manga however, she was a boy. Ed does\nhave family, however they really aren't characters in the show. Just like our other main characters, her past remains unknown for most of the show\n\n-Ein: The dog, not really much else to say here...\n\n-**Art**\n\nI think the art of Bebop looks great, however it does look dated. Meaning that you can easily tell from the art style that this is a 90's anime. This\nis subjective to the viewer, however in my book the art is fantastic, and if you don't mind a little 90's then you should be okay.\n\n-**Sound**\n\nThis really does deserve an honorable mention. The soundtrack of Bebop was done by Yoko Kanno. Basically this means that it is the shit. To be totally\nhonest, this soundtrack gave me a saxo-boner. The opening theme is so exciting, and not to mention all of the other tracks on the soundtrack that\nproduce the appropriate mood for the scene. Bottom line, amazing, and unforgettable\n\n-**Final Thoughts**\n\nEven though this anime is often regarded as “the best anime evar”, there are still many people who have yet to watch this show. And I see too often\npeople dropping the show after the first three episodes simply because the first four are a terrible representation of what the rest of the show will\nbe. If you were to watch this show, I recommend Arkada's viewing order. Watch episodes 5 and 6 first, and then go back and watch 1 through 4. I also\nmust make note of one last thing before I leave you, the dub. As stated in the beginning of this review, Cowboy Bebop is from 90's, normally this\nmeans that you shouldn't touch the dub with a ten foot pole, but this is one hell of an exception. The dub is absolutely stellar with Steve Blum\n(also the voice of Tom, from Toonami) playing Spike. If you wish to watch the show, watch the dub. Even by today's standards, the dub still stands\nfirm.\n\n-**Judgment**\n\nCowboy Bebop is one of my favorite shows, and I recommend it to anyone who has yet to see this master piece. I give this show a:\n\n**9.5/10**\n\n**ASS-tastic (that's good.)**\n\n",

My favorit being \"I’m not going there to die.

        "content": "All right. You guys win. I'm re-reviewing Bebop. Before, I complained heavily about this show, and I didn't care for it, and granted, I still don't\ncare for it. But, I was too hard on this show. This is a genuinely great series, in fact, one of the best out there. It's storyline is epic, but I\nwon't say anything about it, because very few episodes move the story and I don't want to give you any spoilers. That said, a complaint that could\nbe made about the show is the lack of a story. It has a great story, but most of the episodes are just good fun that don't move the story at all.\nOftentimes, the episodes are just about the main characters daily adventures as bounty hunters, (or space cowboys, as you may feel like calling them).\nAnd that's where this show shines.

But, I was too hard on this show. This is a genuinely great series, in fact, one of the best out there. It's storyline is epic, but I won't say anything about it, because very few episodes move the story and I don't want to give you any spoilers. That said, a complaint that could be made about the show is the lack of a story. It has a great story, but most of the episodes are just good fun that don't move the story at all. Oftentimes, the episodes are just about the main characters daily adventures as bounty hunters, (or space cowboys, as you may feel like calling them). And that's where this show shines. It's characters. All of the characters are really cool and interesting, each having their own interesting past. They are all well developed. And of course, Spike Spiegel is amazing.

It reeks of originality, it reeks of attitude, but most of all, it reeks of perfection.I'm not gonna bother\nwriting about how cool the main protagonist Spike Spiegel is, or how colourful the rest of the cast are - those are established facts and have been\ndiscussed to death already, so I'm gonna write about what makes \"Cowboy Bebop\" different instead. Almost everything about it is unusual. It's a\nclash of a huge number of often contradicting styles that, on paper, looks like disasters waiting to happen. However, the reality is that \"Cowboy\nBebop\" takes everything in its stride and pulls off the stunt with flying colours. It catches the attention straight away with its strikingly retro\nopening sequence reminiscent of a typical jazzy 70/80's TV series. The feel of the anime itself is a seamless marriage of anime sci-fi and American\nwesterns, backed up by some slick jazz/blues (as well as other African-American influenced) sound track. Even discounting these obvious western\ninfluences, it's still very un-anime like in a lot of respects - the art style goes for what I would call stylish realism, it's very slightly\ncomically oriented, with no giant eyed cuteness or super distortions in sight. The humour it uses is also mostly toned down, subtle, western humour as\nopposed to the in your face, over the top slap stick found in most other anime. And yet, at other times, its anime roots shine through brightly - for\nexample the character design of Vicious, with his katana and grey/white hair, is about as anime as you can get (well, maybe he could do with longer\nhair, like Sephiroth's from Final Fantasy VII).Even in its content, \"Cowboy Bebop\" breaks new ground. It doesn't go for a long continuous plot,\nbut instead opts for the episodic format, but with one flagship storyline spanning 5 episodes that pops in during various parts of the series. This\ndoesn't sound special by itself, but what is remarkable is the sheer diversity found in the episodes. It proclaims itself to be a work that \"becomes\na new genre in itself\", which might sound arrogant to the point of delusional. But this bold, swaggering claim actually has a ring of truth to it.\n\"Cowboy Bebop\" is like a huge number of genres combined, and yet doesn't fully fit into any particular one simply because it's composed of so\nmany. Like one of those annoying people that you used to know from school who is good at everything, whatever genre \"Cowboy Bebop\" touches turns to\ngold. The comedy is hilarious, the action is edge of the seat stuff, and the horror themed episodes do manage to create a kind of unsettling\natmosphere of anticipation and suspense. I think almost everyone will find something to their taste. Moreover, since I haven't anything like this\ndone before, and anything that comes after that dares to attempt anything that's even remotely similar will be seen as copying (for example, even\nthough \"Samurai Champloo\", produced by the same person, is an undoubted success, it had no where near the impact of \"Cowboy Bebop\"), \"Cowboy\nBebop\" has effectively cemented itself as a unique experience in a class of its own. Quite a few of the episodes in \"Cowboy Bebop\" reveals some of\nthe characters' backgrounds, but they don't reveal everything. For the most part, only subtle hints are given, and you're left to join up the\nsparsely distributed dots using your own imagination. Usually I hate this kind of thing, but you know what? In the special case of \"Cowboy Bebop\",\nit somehow WORKS. In this case, less is more, the show's incomplete state feels just right, and the tantalising bits of clues and short flashbacks\npiece together into a enigmatic, fragmental past that adds to rather than detract from the flavour of the anime. There is no better example of this\nthan during the flagship storyline where we catch a glimpse of Spike's mysterious past. In fact these episodes deserves special mention - they are\nclearly meant to be the diamonds amongst the gems. In crafting these episodes, the creators obviously asked themselves the question: the short\nstories' collective strength lies their variety, so what can we do with this central attraction to make it stand out? The answer was obvious: it was\nto make it into something that's the very definition of awesomeness. And boy did they achieve it. The general gist of this story is Spike settling\nscores with Vicious, an old enemy from his little known past. It's a classic set up that's been used many, many times before, and on the face of it,\n\"Cowboy Bebop\" doesn't really bring anything new to the table. But saying this segment of \"Cowboy Bebop\" is just another one of those show down\nbetween nemesis stories is like saying J. S. Bach is just another Baroque composer. Bach was not known as an innovator, and distinguished himself as\nthe greatest composer of his time simply by being so much better than everyone else. In the same way, \"Cowboy Bebop\" took a much used idea and,\ndespite not doing anything that's different, produced something that's on a completely different plane to everything else. Everything about \"Cowboy\nBebop\" is already smooth and polished, but in those episodes the production somehow manages to climb up yet another level, and every single fiber of\nit is executed to perfection.That Spike vs Vicious segment of \"Cowboy Bebop\" is so good in fact, that viewers often mistake it as the only story\n\"Cowboy Bebop\" is trying to tell, and thus the other episodes naturally gets mistaken as fillers, and this is one of the most common criticisms\nlevelled at \"Cowboy Bebop\" - it's composed almost entirely of fillers. But I think this is missing the whole point of the series. Just like a\nserious show should not be faulted for not being funny, \"Cowboy Bebop\" should not be faulted for being episodic, but should be judged based on what\nit's trying to achieve. What it is trying to achieve is variety, and thus purposefully avoided the continuous story format. Those \"fillers\" are\nessential building blocks towards achieving this aim, and so shouldn't really be regarded as fillers at all. Real fillers would be like in \"Full\nMoon wo Sagashite\", where they actually got a continuous story to tell, but instead of telling it chose to go faffing around on mostly unrelated mini\nadventures that nearly put me to sleep. The key question is does \"Cowboy Bebop\" deliver what it's trying to deliver, and there is no doubt in my\nmind that is does.It's generally acknowledged that \"Cowboy Bebop\" is not a deep anime, so the fact that shows up at the top of so many critics'\nlist arguably makes it the biggest triumph for a style over substance anime. The show's ending theme is called \"The Real Folk's Blues\"\n(ironically, it's actually a rock song) - rather appropriately, I thought, because this series frequently give rise to some of the most\ncontemplative, melancholy moments despite not being terribly deep. These kind of moments often left me with a feeling of immense fulfilment as the end\ncredits starts to roll. Perhaps it's this engimatic quality that lends it that special aura.

        "content": "Cowboy Bebop is an absolute classic. Most people would say this is 'the pinnacle of all anime shows'. While there are some aspects of the show I\nliked, to say that this is the BEST of the BEST seems a little far-fetched to me.\n\nCowboy Bebop is set in the distant future where space travel has been developed. Bounty hunters exist around the solar system to capture criminals and\nsurvive by being rewarded for their bounty. The story centres around 4 main characters - Spike Spiegel, Jet Black, Faye Valentine and Edward Wong Hau\nPepelu Tivrusky IV (or Ed) and it tells us of their journeys and struggles.\n\nI'll get a lot of the repeated praises out of the way first, before people completely disregard the whole review for the issues I had with the show.\n\nThe animation is splendid - that, I simply cannot deny. For a 1998 anime, the quality definitely rivals the most up to date ones and still surpasses a\nvast majority of them. The movements of the characters and attention to detail in the backgrounds are so crisp clean, it is virtually eye candy for\nany viewer.\n\nAnother thing Cowboy Bebop succeeds in is the soundtrack. The opening song 'Tank!' is one of the most iconic tune in anime history and will be\nimmediately recognised by most anime watchers. Although the opening song and background music aren't suited to my tastes (by that I mean I wouldn't\nlisten to them on my MP3 player) it sets the mood perfectly for most of the scenes within the show. Another compliment goes to the ending theme song\n'The real folk blues' which I frickin love (Now THAT is on my MP3 playlist).\n\nAs for the voice acting, both the English and Japanese voice actors/actresses have done a wonderful job bringing the characters to life. Their\nperformances in their own respective languages has virtually no flaws. So if you ask me which language to watch it in, it would be - it doesn't\nmatter, both are good, it really is up to you.\n\nNow here's where I must be careful of what I say...\n\nSo why couldn't I enjoy this as much as the 99% of people who declare that this is the definition of masterpiece? I guess the main reason would be\nthe episodic nature of the show. Of course this is subjective from person to person. I personally would have liked to see the characters have an\noverall goal where a satisfying conclusion is met rather than individual episodes with their own plots.\n\nBut that isn't where the real problem lies. A good show should have a great start which draws the viewer in, a strong central story where character\ndevelopment can take place and finally, it should have a memorable ending. Unfortunately, the first few episodes of Cowboy Bebop aren't that\nentertaining. It's average at best but nothing spectacular to draw the audience into the show, if anything pretty standard fair to introduce all the\ncharacters.\n\nIt picks up its pace and starts to get interesting when it reaches the episode 'Ballad of Fallen Angels' (episode 5). I don't want to spoil\nanything, but this is the first episode where the anime gets more serious. We learn a little about Spike's past and it starts to get more\nfascinating... BUT here's where I feel Cowboy Bebop fails at. The episode just ends. It side tracks to something else. The next episode is something\ncompletely different, which isn't necessarily a bad thing but it feels that what I've just seen gets abandoned - tossed to the side. Any tension\nbuilt up from the previous episode is just gone and this happens throughout the show and I get REALLY irritated.\n\nI want to know more, but it never gives me that satisfaction. It's like the series is about to show something interesting, but then completely\nforgets about it in .5 of a second. It would be okay if the episodes after the 'serious' ones were JUST AS fascinating. But this simply isn't the\ncase. They are decent/fine at best and this contrast from watching something amazing to plain average constantly gives the feeling of disappointment.\nNow this doesn't make it a bad show. It just means the series is mediocre to worth watching but nothing incredible for it to be called a\n'masterpiece'.\n\nOne more thing to add to the individual plots for the other episodes. It is either hit or miss in terms of how entertaining it is. There were some\nwhich I would have liked a continuation of, however, in most cases it just ends. It isn't a coincidence that the only episodes I genuinely enjoyed\nwere the ones where they reveal a little about why the characters are the way they are now - a prime example would be Faye Valentines past. And as for\nthe other episodes, I feel \"meh\" towards them.\n\nFinally, for the ending... it's very good... I don't want to talk about it as it contains spoilers. All I can say is, it's a very fitting way to\nend the show.\n\nMaybe I'm being too harsh in this review... hmm... okay... so if the story isn't a masterpiece, surely the characters should be able to 'carry'\nthe series - so entertaining that simple actions by them make the whole show a masterpiece. Unfortunately, they aren't the most jaw dropping\nfascinating characters I've seen. Now before you shoot me down with a bazooka: allow me to explain; the main characters are very interesting but I\nfeel that the show does nothing with them. I understand that Spike is supposed to be cool but the story doesn't do much to show that. Yes he is good\nlooking, yes he has a sense of justice, yes he fights like a boss but... that seems like a stereotype to me. I would have liked to know more about his\npast, what did he suffer to become the way he is? Why is he so attached to Julia? These kind of questions pop-up not just for Spike but for the other\nmain characters too. One possible reason for this could be Cowboy Bebop only has 26 episodes, it's quite difficult to explain everything in such a\nshort time span.\n\nThough the biggest problem for me was the supporting characters. I simply didn't give a damn about them. I wasn't particularly attached to them nor\nwere they particularly memorable. Naturally for an episodic show like this, there are guaranteed to be characters which will be more interesting than\nothers. The problem is, I felt no attachment to approximately 95% of the characters.\n\nLet me give an example of one of the supporting characters, Vicious. He is the most interesting support character (in my opinion) and is supposedly\nthe villain of the show but I can't help but question things like \"why is Vicious like this?\", \"why is he supposedly the villain?\", \"what are\nhis motivations?\" It feels as though he's just there for us to 'agree' that he is a bad guy when there's no real reason for it. This is what I\nmean by the contrast of the serious episodes to the non-serious ones. I'm about to learn something from Vicious but the next episode just completely\nabandons the idea with the metaphorical 'episodic reset button'.\n\nAll in all though, the main characters aren't bad but they aren't ones where I would stare in awe at everything they say. The supporting characters\nare - well to put it bluntly, weak. By that I mean they simply aren't memorable and it's not something where you would look back and go \"maaan that\nyoung child who shot Spike is so cool - he's one really likable character\".\n\nNow, let me just say Cowboy Bebop is by no means a bad show. Far from it actually. It passes with flying colours in the presentation aspect but I\nsimply couldn't buy into the episodic style of the story with characters that didn't really do anything. I just don't think it truly is the\n'pinnacle of all anime shows'. However, it harbours a 'worth watching' in my rating system and should be viewed by anyone as it is STILL a\nclassic.\n\n",

Any tension built up from the previous episode is just gone and this happens throughout the show and I get REALLY irritated.</p><p>I want to know more, but it never gives me that satisfaction. It's like the series is about to show something interesting, but then completely forgets about it in .5 of a second. It would be okay if the episodes after the 'serious' ones were JUST AS fascinating. But this simply isn't the case. They are decent/fine at best and this contrast from watching something amazing to plain average constantly gives the feeling of disappointment. Now this doesn't make it a bad show. It just means the series is mediocre to worth watching but nothing incredible for it to be called a 'masterpiece'.</p><p>One more thing to add to the individual plots for the other episodes. It is either hit or miss in terms of how entertaining it is. There were some which I would have liked a continuation of, however, in most cases it just ends. It isn't a coincidence that the only episodes I genuinely enjoyed were the ones where they reveal a little about why the characters are the way they are now - a prime example would be Faye Valentines past. And as for the other episodes, I feel \"meh\" towards them.</p><p>Finally, for the ending... it's very good... I don't want to talk about it as it contains spoilers. All I can say is, it's a very fitting way to end the show.</p><p>Maybe I'm being too harsh in this review... hmm... okay... so if the story isn't a masterpiece, surely the characters should be able to 'carry' the series - so entertaining that simple actions by them make the whole show a masterpiece. Unfortunately, they aren't the most jaw dropping fascinating characters I've seen. Now before you shoot me down with a bazooka: allow me to explain; the main characters are very interesting but I feel that the show does nothing with them. I understand that Spike is supposed to be cool but the story doesn't do much to show that. Yes he is good looking, yes he has a sense of justice, yes he fights like a boss but... that seems like a stereotype to me. I would have liked to know more about his past, what did he suffer to become the way he is? Why is he so attached to Julia? These kind of questions pop-up not just for Spike but for the other main characters too. One possible reason for this could be Cowboy Bebop only has 26 episodes, it's quite difficult to explain everything in such a short time span.</p><p>Though the biggest problem for me was the supporting characters. I simply didn't give a damn about them. I wasn't particularly attached to them nor were they particularly memorable. Naturally for an episodic show like this, there are guaranteed to be characters which will be more interesting than others. The problem is, I felt no attachment to approximately 95% of the characters.</p><p>Let me give an example of one of the supporting characters, Vicious. He is the most interesting support character (in my opinion) and is supposedly the villain of the show but I can't help but question things like \"why is Vicious like this?\", \"why is he supposedly the villain?\", \"what are his motivations?\" It feels as though he's just there for us to 'agree' that he is a bad guy when there's no real reason for it. This is what I mean by the contrast of the serious episodes to the non-serious ones. I'm about to learn something from Vicious but the next episode just completely abandons the idea with the metaphorical 'episodic reset button'.</p><p>All in all though, the main characters aren't bad but they aren't ones where I would stare in awe at everything they say. The supporting characters are - well to put it bluntly, weak. By that I mean they simply aren't memorable and it's not something where you would look back and go \"maaan that young child who shot Spike is so cool - he's one really likable character\".</p><p>Now, let me just say Cowboy Bebop is by no means a bad show. Far from it actually. It passes with flying colours in the presentation aspect but I simply couldn't buy into the episodic style of the story with characters that didn't really do anything. I just don't think it truly is the 'pinnacle of all anime shows'. However, it harbours a 'worth watching' in my rating system and should be viewed by anyone as it is STILL a classic.</p>",

While most series have a large scale plot that goes from point a to point b (not\nsaying this is a bad thing), Cowboy Bebop tells the story through individual adventures that the crew goes on, with some episodes focused on certain\ncharacters providing back story and further development.

I love the story in Cowboy Bebop, but one of my only problem is that the beginning is a little slow.\nWhile we do have the action filled introduction, things start to get interesting at Episode 5: Ballad of Fallen Angels, one of my favorite Anime\nepisodes of all time.

        "content": "As someone who never really watched Cowboy Bebop in his childhood, i went into this anime hoping for something more a kin to DBZ or One Piece, because\nas we all know that things that were awesome when you were 6 don't really hold up as well when your 19. It's been over 2 years since i first saw\nthis anime and I am still reminded from time to time, as an anime fan that if i don't call this anime the,\"best anime evar made\" I must be the\nspawn of satin. With that out of the way let's do this.\n\n**The Story** follows Spike a bounty hunter in the future where people have inhabited multiple planets and satellites in the solar system, but anyone\ncan find that out by reading the Wikipedia on the damn thing. if you are reading this then you want critique and that is what i am here for. The Story\noverall is great but it is kind of sluggish and vague in its depiction. What i mean by that is that it is not in your face, and the certain sense of\naloof-ness (if that is even a word) only adds to the charm of the story itself. I guess what i am trying to say that cowboy bebop is a Ferrari in the\ncountry side and you are just along for the slow ride.  **The Animation** is where this anime out performs. As a series form 1998 i did not expect\nmuch, i mean Great Teacher Onizuka (GTO) is from around the same time but that looks like a kindergartner's vomit compared to the animation of Cowboy\nBebop. Even though i started the series on a DVD borrowed from a friend and ended the show on a bluray re-release, the animation still held up in both\nversions.   \nTop notch animation coupled with the perfect <b>Sound and Music </b>made this anime a perfect blend, oh god i can't tell you enough how much i like\nthe Jazz-esk mosaique that is this anime. Never have i personally seen the music the animation and the character be present in such harmony.  \nAll the **Characters** are cool ,by far the coolest characters i've seen in anime. Voiced to perfection by the Japanese and English cast which again\nis rare to see from an anime from the late 90s, I dare you just check out GTO and Golden Boy, both amazing anime but the English Voice acting sub-par\nin both cases. Spike specially is one of the coolest if the most coolest animated characters (be it western animation or eastern). In this vague, slow\nand aloof plot exists an **enjoyable** anime, that is really too cool for you, my gripes with are far and few in between, but calling it the best\nanime ever. Ummm nooo. It is that sense of aloof-ness that makes it cool but also makes it distant, it is by no means a perfect anime but a damn good\none, just damn damn damn good. \n\nMy personal verdict I am personally glad anime like this exist even though they are so few that you can count them with a horses hooves. It is not the\nbest anime, but i will say it is probably in the top 10 anime ever made. If you have never seen it, go see it. If you are new to anime and find it\nweird, this is the anime for you. Give it time and i promise you it will give you one of the enjoyable TV experience. Specially the final scene. Thank\nyou for reading my review, and **BANG! (**come back after the anime to get this one.**)**\n\n",
